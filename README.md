# Trimension

This project contains a collection of experiments built with Three.js, React.js, and Tailwind CSS. The experiments are interactive 3D scenes that showcase the capabilities of Three.js and demonstrate how it can be used to create immersive web experiences.

## Experiments

The following experiments are included in this project:

### Room

This experiment is a 3D room that was built from scratch using Three.js. The room contains furniture and electronics, and you can interact with the objects to move them around and rotate them. The experiment also includes lighting and shadows to make the scene more realistic.

### Person

This experiment is still in its initial phase but the main objective would be to build a 3D person from scratch.
